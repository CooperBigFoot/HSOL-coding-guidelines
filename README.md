# hydrosolutions Coding Standards & Best Practices

Welcome to the official repository for hydrosolutions' coding standards and best practices!

## Purpose

This repository serves as the central hub for documenting our agreed-upon guidelines, styles, and processes for writing code within the company. Our goal is to:

* **Improve Code Quality:** Write more robust, reliable, and maintainable code.
* **Enhance Collaboration:** Make it easier for team members to understand, review, and contribute to each other's work.
* **Promote Knowledge Sharing:** Build a collective understanding of best practices relevant to our work in water resources management, machine learning, and remote sensing.
* **Reduce Technical Debt:** Establish sustainable coding habits that prevent future rework and complications.
* **Streamline Onboarding:** Help new team members quickly understand our development practices.

## Target Audience

These documents are primarily intended for all employees at hydrosolutions who are involved in writing, reviewing, or managing code.

## Key Documents

This repository will contain guidelines covering various aspects of our development workflow. Planned and current documents include:

* **`coding-philosophy.md`**: Our overarching principles and mindset towards coding.
* **`python-best-practices.md`**: Specific guidelines for writing Python code, our primary language for analysis and development.
* **`code-reviews-best-practices.md`**: How we conduct and participate in code reviews to ensure quality and share knowledge.
* **`git-workflow.md`**: Our standard practices for using Git and GitHub for version control.
* **`ai-assisted-development.md`**: Guidelines for effectively and responsibly using AI tools in our coding tasks.
* *(Potentially others as we identify needs, e.g., `data-management-guidelines.md`, `project-structure.md`)*

## How to Use These Documents

* **As a Reference:** Consult these documents when you're unsure about a specific coding convention or process.
* **During Code Reviews:** Use these standards as a basis for providing and receiving feedback.
* **As Living Documents:** These guidelines are not set in stone. We expect them to evolve as our team grows, our tools change, and we learn new best practices.

## Contributing

Your input is valuable! If you have suggestions for improvements, new topics to cover, or identify areas that need clarification:

1. **Discuss:** Raise your ideas with the team (e.g., during a team meeting, or by creating an "Issue" in this repository).
2. **Propose Changes:** Feel free to create a branch, make your proposed changes, and submit a Pull Request for review.

Let's work together to build a strong and effective coding culture at hydrosolutions!
